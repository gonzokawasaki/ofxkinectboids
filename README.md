ofxkinectboids
==============

kinect input into a boids framework

xcode

please feel free to use

thanks to alex for openi setup

the kinect data captured is not really used to its fullest extent as yet, had hoped to make the boids respond to the
kinect more subtly. atm they just run away from origin when kinect sensor picks up near object.
